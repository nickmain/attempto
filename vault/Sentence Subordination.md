In sentence subordination a transitive verb takes a complete sentence as an object.

* `A clerk believes that a customer inserts a card.`

If, and only if, the main sentence and the subordinated sentence have the same subject as in 

* `John wants that John inserts a card.` 

then sentence subordination can be more concisely expressed as 

* `John wants to insert a card.`

Notice that adverbs and prepositional phrases modifying the verb of the main sentence can only occur before the verb of the main sentence as in the example below, but are not allowed between the verb of the main sentence and `that`, respectively `to`.

* `John eagerly in the morning wants to insert a card.`
