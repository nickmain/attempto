It is possible to create well-formed sentences without a verb, by using the _there is/are_ construction.

>* _there is_ + [[Noun Phrase|noun phrase]]
>* _there are_ + [[Noun Phrase|noun phrase]]

This construct just introduces the entities described by the noun phrase into the discourse, or if negated, denies their existence. 

For this reason noun phrases following _there is/are_ cannot be and cannot contain:

* definite noun phrases
* universally quantified noun phrases
* proper names
* numbers
* arithmetic expressions
* strings
* sets
* lists 


>[!example]
>* There is a customer.
>* There is some water.
>* There are more than 6 clerks.
>* There are a cat and 2 dogs.
>* There is X.
>* There is no man who sleeps.
>* There is a cat in a garden.
>* There is a cat that sleeps.
