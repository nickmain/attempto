Generally, word class intersections are allowed; e.g. the verb "eats" can be declared as an [[Intransitive Verbs|intransitive verb]] and as a [[Transitive Verbs|transitive verb]] at the same time. But there are some intersections that are not allowed:

- [[Adverbs]] are not allowed to intersect with [[Countable Nouns]] or [[Mass Nouns]].
- [[Adverbs]] are not allowed to intersect with [[Intransitive Verbs]].
- [[Intransitive Adjectives]] are not allowed to intersect with [[Transitive Adjectives]].
- [[Proper Names|Proper Names]] with a definite article are not allowed to intersect with [[Countable Nouns]] or [[Mass Nouns]].
- [[Prepositions]] are not allowed to intersect with [[Intransitive Adjectives]].
- [[Prepositions]] are not allowed to intersect with [[Transitive Verbs]].

The following table illustrates these restrictions. Fields containing an "X" denote intersections that are not allowed. (The gray fields are a mirror image of the white ones.)
