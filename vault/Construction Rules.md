## ACE Texts

An ACE text is a sequence of [[Declarative Sentences|declarative]], [[Interrogative Sentences|interrogative]] and [[Imperative Sentences|imperative]] sentences. 

All sentences can anaphorically refer to preceding declarative sentences, but not to interrogative and imperative sentences.

>[!example]
>* Mary enters a card into a machine. Its screen blinks or Mary waits.
>* A man has a car. Does he see the car? John, identify the car!

#### Composite Sentences

Composite sentences are recursively built from simple sentences, _there is/are_-sentences, boolean formulas, and other composite sentences with the help of the predefined constructors:

- coordination
- quantification 
- global quantification
- subordination

##### Coordinated Sentences

##### Locally Quantified Sentences

##### Globally Quantified Sentences

##### Subordination

ACE knows five forms of sentence subordination:

- conditional sentences (_if-then_ sentences)
- logical negation
- negation as failure
- modality
- sentence subordination

###### Conditional Sentences
###### Logical Negation
###### Negation as Failure
###### Modality
###### Sentence Subordination


### Interrogative Sentences



### Imperative Sentences

ACE supports simple imperative sentences, briefly called commands. A command consists of a [[Construction Rules#Noun Phrases|noun phrase]] (the addressee), followed by a comma, followed by an uncoordinated [[Construction Rules#Verb Phrases|verb phrase]] (possibly negated). A command must end with an exclamation mark.

>[!example]
>* John, go to your own bank!
>* John and Mary, clean yourselves!
>* Every dog, do not bark!
>* John's brother, return the book to Mary!
