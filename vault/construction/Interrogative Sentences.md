ACE allows three forms of interrogative sentences.

Interrogative sentences must end with a question mark.

---
### Yes/No Queries

_Yes/No_ queries can be answered by yes/no.

>[!example]
>* Does John enter a card?
>* Does John not wait?
>* Do John and Mary wait in a garden?
>* Is the card valid?
>* Is the card not valid?
>* Is it true that a man waits?
>* Is it false that a man waits?

### Wh- Queries

The _wh_-queries:

* `who`
* `whose`
* `what`
* `which`
 
ask for the subject or an object of a sentence, while

* `how`
* `where`
* `when`  

ask for modifiers of the verb.

Since the query words can often be placed before the verb and after the verb most questions have alternative equivalent formulations.

>[!example]
>* Who waits?
>* Who wait? (= Who waits?)
>* Each of who waits?
>* Whose dog barks?
>* A card of who is valid?
>* Who does John not see? (alternatively: John does not see who?)
>* Who is John? (alternatively: John is who?)
>* What does a man not eat? (alternatively: A man does not eat what?)
>* Which customer enters a card and types a code?
>* How does John enter a card? (alternatively: John enters a card how?)
>* Where does John wait? (alternatively: John waits where?)
>* When does John wait? (alternatively: John waits when?)
>* There is who? (alternatively: Who is there?)
>* There is which man? (alternatively: Which man is there?)
>* Where is John? (alternatively: John is who?)

### How much/many Queries. 

The _how much/many_-queries ask for the amount of a mass or measurement noun, or for the number of countable nouns. The queries can be used as subjects or objects of a sentence.

>[!example]
>* How much water boils?
>* How many men wait?
>* How many men have how many apples?
>* John gives how much food to how many children?
