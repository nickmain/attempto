In addition to logical negation, ACE provides negation as failure (`... does/do/is/are not provably ...`). For negation as failure of sentences see [[Subordination]].

>[!example]
>* John does not provably wait. 
>* The men do not provably work. 
>* John is not provably a teacher. 
>* The men are not provably admitted.
