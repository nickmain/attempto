The copula `be` must be followed by a noun phrase, an adjective phrase, a concatenation of prepositional phrases or a query word. 

For the use of the copula in interrogative sentences see [[Interrogative Sentences]].

>[!example]
>* John is a rich customer. 
>* John's age is 32. 
>* John and Mary are two teachers. 
>* John is rich. 
>* John is in the garden on the hill. 
>* John is who?

An adjective phrase following the copula can use a transitive or an intransitive adjective. In both cases, the adjective can be positive, comparative, or superlative. Transitive adjectives always take a prepositional phrase as a complement and the preposition must be hyphenated to the adjective. Intransitive adjectives following a copula can be conjoined, but transitive adjectives cannot.

>[!example]
>* John is rich. John is richer. (= John is more rich.) 
>* John is richest. (= John is most rich.) 
>* A customer is rich and more important and most successful. 
>* John is fond-of Mary. 
>* John is more fond-of Mary. (= John is fonder-of Mary.)
>* John is most fond-of Mary. (= John is fondest-of Mary.) 
>* A customer is rich and interested-in a bank.

For the positive and comparative forms, a comparison target can be defined using `as ... as` or `more ... than`, respectively. In this case conjunction of the adjectives is not possible.

>[!example]
>* John is as rich as Mary. 
>* John is richer than Mary. 
>* John is as fond-of Mary as Bill. 
>* John is more fond-of Mary than Bill. 
>* A customer is as rich as John and important. 
>* A customer is richer than John and important.

---
In the case of transitive adjectives, one can repeat the preposition in order to make the object be the target of the comparison. (In the examples above, the subject was the target of the comparison.)

>[!example]
>* John is as fond-of Mary as of Sue. 
>* John is more fond-of Mary than of Sue.
