All verb phrases can be modified by adverbs and by prepositional phrases. Modifiers can precede the verb phrase or follow it (with the exception of [[Subordination|sentence subordination]]).

As the following examples show, not each choice of positioning an adverb or a prepositional phrase feels natural, but being able to put adverbs and prepositional phrases in different positions allows you to respect English pragmatics.

>[!example] Adverbs and prepositional phrases can **precede** the verb phrase
>* A customer manually inserts a card. 
>* A customer into a slot inserts a card. 
>* Every customer usually is curious. 
>* Every customer in the beginning is inexperienced.

>[!example] Adverbs and prepositional phrases can **follow** the verb phrase.
>* A customer inserts a card manually. 
>* A customer inserts a card into a slot. 
>* Every customer is curious usually. 
>* Every customer is inexperienced in the beginning.

>[!example] Both positions can be combined
>* A customer manually inserts a card into a slot.

In [[Subordination|sentence subordination]] modifiers of the verb of the main phrase must occur immediately before the verb. No modifiers are allowed between the verb of the main phrase and `that`, respectively `to`.

>[!example]
>* John seriously in the morning believes that Mary fills-in a form. 
>* John seriously in the morning wants to fill-in a form.

>[!example] Adverbs can be used in their positive, comparative, or superlative forms
>* A customer waits patiently.
>* A customer waits more patiently.
>* A customer most patiently waits.

>[!note] Observe the difference between: 
>* A student is **interested-in** a course.
>* A student is **interested in** a classroom.

If several modifiers are used, two or more adverbs must be conjoined by `and`, two or more prepositional phrases must be concatenated, and a sequence of adverbs and prepositional phrases must be concatenated.

>[!example]
>* A customer inserts a card carefully and manually. 
>* A customer waits in a bank in the morning. 
>* A customer carefully and manually inserts a card into the slot in the bank. 
>* John usually in the current year is a rich customer in England.
