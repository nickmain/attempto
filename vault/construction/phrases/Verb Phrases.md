ACE verbs occurring in declarative or interrogative sentences are third person and simple present tense. 

Passives are built with the past participle and must have a prepositional phrase `... by ...` . 

ACE verbs occurring in imperative sentences are second person.

Verbs can be intransitive (*wait*), transitive (*enter something*), and ditransitive (*give something to somebody* / *give someone something*). 

Phrasal particles and those prepositions that introduce a complement of a transitive verb, must be hyphenated to the verb. Prepositions for the indirect object of ditransitive verbs are not hyphenated since they do not immediately follow the verb. 

The copula `be` as a special case is treated separately (see [[Copula]]).
