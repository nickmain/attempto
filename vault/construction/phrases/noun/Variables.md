Variables can be introduced as noun phrase apposition, and can then be used as noun phrases. Variable names consist of a single upper case letter, optionally followed by an integer.

* `A man X sleeps. X is young.` 
* `If somebody D1 is a dog then D1 is an animal.`

If a variable is introduced as apposition to `something` then it is possible to omit `something`. These variables are called "_bare_".

* `X weighs 300 kg. X is heavy.` (= `Something X weighs 300 kg. X is heavy.`)
