Elements of sets and lists are 

* [[Integer and Real Numbers]]
* [[Arithmetic Expressions]]
* [[Variables]]
* [[Strings]]
* [[Proper Names]]

>[!example]
>* {} 
>* {3, 6, [1,2]} 
>* [] 
>* [3, 4, 5, "ab", John, 1+2]


>[!note] Operations on sets and lists could be expressed in natural language. Possible examples:
>* {} is a subset of {3, 6}
>* X is an element of [3, 4, 5]
