Arithmetic expressions are built from numbers, variables and proper names with the help of the operators

* `+`
* `-`
* `*`
* `/`
* `^`

Standard operator precedence applies. Sub-expressions can be put in parentheses to modify the precedence of the operators. This applies specifically to iterated occurrences of the exponentiation operator `^`.

>[!example]
>* 1 + 2 / X * 4 
>* (1 + 2) / X * 4 
>* Pi/2 
>* 2 ^ 3 
>* 2 ^ (3 ^ 4) vs. (2 ^ 3) ^ 4
