Various genitive constructs can optionally be attached to a noun phrase: `of`-prepositional phrases, Saxon genitives and possessive pronouns. 

Possessive pronouns are non-reflexive:

* `your`
* `its`
* `his`
* `her`
* `his/her`
* `their`

or reflexive:

* `your own`
* `its own`
* `his own`
* `her own`
* `his/her own`
* `their own`

Note that the Saxon genitive can only be used with a single noun while the `of`-prepositional phrase can be followed by a conjunctive noun phrase.

>[!example]
>* a customer of John 
>* a dog of John and Mary (= a dog of {John and Mary}) 
>* John's customer 
>* John and Mary's dog (= John and {Mary's dog}) 
>* everybody's customer
>* every man's dog 
>* X's dog 
>* his customer 
>* his own customer 
>* your customer
