A relative clause can optionally follow a noun phrase, a proper name, or an indefinite pronoun. 

Relative clauses can be coordinated by `and` and by `or`.

>[!example]
>* a customer that is rich
>* a customer who is rich and who is well-known 
>* a man who waits or who sleeps 
>* John who waits 
>* some men each of who waits 
>* everything which is important
