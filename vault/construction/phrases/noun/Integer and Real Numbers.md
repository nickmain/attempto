Integer and real numbers are predefined. 

* An integer is a non-empty sequence of digits (0-9). 
* A real number consists of a non-empty sequence of digits (0-9) followed by a period followed by a non-empty sequence of digits (0-9). 

Positive integers and positive real numbers must not be prefixed by a plus sign (+). Negative integers and negative real numbers are prefixed by a minus sign (-).
