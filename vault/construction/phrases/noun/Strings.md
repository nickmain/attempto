Strings consists of a sequence of Unicode characters enclosed in double quotes `"..."`. 

Quotation marks and backslashes within strings have to be escaped by a backslash. 

Strings, variables, proper names and bracketed strings can be concatenated by the left-associative operator `&`.  

>[!example]
>* "" 
>* "abc" 
>* "ab\\"cd" 
>* "ab\\\\cd" 
>* "abc" & "123"
