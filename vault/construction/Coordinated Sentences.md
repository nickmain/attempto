Sentences can be coordinated by

* `and`
* `or`
* `,and`
* `,or`

Coordination by `and` and `or` is governed by the standard binding order of logic, i.e. `and` binds stronger than `or`. The coordinators `,and` and `,or` can be used to override the standard binding order.

>[!example]
>* The screen blinks and John waits.
>* The screen blinks or John waits.
>* The screen blinks or John waits, and Mary enters a card.
