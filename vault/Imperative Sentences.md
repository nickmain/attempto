ACE supports simple imperative sentences, briefly called commands. A command consists of a [[Noun Phrase|noun phrase]] (the addressee), followed by a comma, followed by an uncoordinated [[Verb Phrase|verb phrase]] (possibly negated). A command must end with an exclamation mark.

>[!example]
>* John, go to your own bank!
>* John and Mary, clean yourselves!
>* Every dog, do not bark!
>* John's brother, return the book to Mary!
