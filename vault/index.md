From the [home page of the Attempto project](http://attempto.ifi.uzh.ch/site/):

>[[Attempto Controlled English]] (ACE) is aÂ [[Controlled Natural Language]], i.e. a rich subset of standard English designed to serve as knowledge representation language. ACE allows users to express texts precisely, and in the terms of their respective application domain. As any language, ACE must be learned to be used competently, but this amounts to learning the differences between ACE and full English, formulated as a small set of ACE construction and interpretation rules. To simplify using ACE we have been developing the ACE Editor that helps users to construct correct ACE texts without having to learn it. Once written, ACE texts can be read and understood by anybody.

This site aims to be documentation for various implementations of [[Attempto Controlled English|Attempto]] currently being developed by the author.
