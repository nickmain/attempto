>[[Attempto Controlled English]] (ACE) is aÂ [[Controlled Natural Language]], i.e. a rich subset of standard English designed to serve as knowledge representation language. [[Attempto Controlled English|ACE]] allows users to express texts precisely, and in the terms of their respective application domain. As any language, [[Attempto Controlled English|ACE]] must be learned to be used competently, but this amounts to learning the differences between [[Attempto Controlled English|ACE]] and full English, formulated as a small set of [[Attempto Controlled English|ACE]] construction and interpretation rules. To simplify using [[Attempto Controlled English|ACE]] we have been developing the [[Attempto Controlled English|ACE]] Editor that helps users to construct correct [[Attempto Controlled English|ACE]] texts without having to learn it. Once written, [[Attempto Controlled English|ACE]] texts can be read and understood by anybody.

This site aims to be documentation for various implementations of [[Attempto Controlled English|Attempto]] currently being developed by the author.
