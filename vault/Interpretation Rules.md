Each ACE sentence has only one meaning. However, if interpreted in full English, an ACE sentence can have many meanings. The following interpretation rules specify which of the conceivable meanings a sentence has in ACE. 

>[!note]
>To clarify the scopes of a sentence we use `{...}`. This should not be confused with the notation used for sets. 
>
>To explain anaphoric references we use `[...]` which should not be confused with the notation for lists. 
>
>A sentence prefixed with ðŸˆ² is not part of ACE, but serves as counter example.
