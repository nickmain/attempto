title: Strings

Strings consists of a sequence of Unicode characters enclosed in double quotes `"..."`. 

Quotation marks and backslashes within strings have to be escaped by a backslash. 

Strings, variables, proper names and bracketed strings can be concatenated by the left-associative operator `&`. The operator `&` has a type, meaning that all arguments must eventually stand for strings.
