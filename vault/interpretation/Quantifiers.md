## The Determiner a Means Existential Quantification

The determiner `a` means existential quantification, not universal quantification. To express universal quantification use, for example, `every`. Compare the following two sentences.

* `A cat is an animal.` (= `There is a cat that is an animal.`) 
* `Every cat is an animal.` (= `If there is a cat then the cat is an animal.`)

## Scopes of Local Quantifiers

The textual position of a local quantifier (universal: `every`, `each`, ...; existential: `a`/`an`, `some`, ...) opens its scope that extends to the end of the sentence; in sentence coordinations the scope extends to the end of the respective coordinated sentence.

* `{A customer types {every code}}. `
* `{Every customer types {a code}}.` 
* `{Every customer has a card} and {a customer has a code}.`

## Scopes of Global Quantifiers

The textual position of a global quantifier (universal: `for every`, `for each`, ...; existential: `there is a/an`, `there is some`, ...) opens its scope that extends to the end of the sentence, coordinated or not.

* `{For every customer the customer has a card and the customer has a code}.`

## Equivalence of Universally Quantified and Conditional Sentences

Note that universally quantified sentences and conditional sentences are interpreted equivalently, e.g.

* `Every customer enters a card.`

is equivalent to

* `If there is a customer then the customer enters a card.`
