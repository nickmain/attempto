By default, plural noun phrases have a collective reading; distributive reading is indicated by `each of`.

* collective reading: `A clerk enters two cards.` 
* distributive reading: `A clerk enters each of two cards.`

A collective plural, for instance `two girls`, denotes a group of two girls that is viewed as a whole. A distributive plural, for example `each of two girls`, denotes a set of two girls that are considered individually.

* `Two girls lift a table.` - There is one act of lifting in which two girls together lift a table. In other words, there is one relation between two girls and one table.

* `Each of two girls lifts a table.` - There are two acts of lifting in each of which one of the two girls individually lifts a table â€” not necessarily the same one. That is to say, there are two relations between each of the two girls and a table.
