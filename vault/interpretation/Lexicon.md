## Overlap of Countable and Mass Nouns

Some nouns, for instance `laundry`, have both a countable interpretation (`a laundry`) and a mass interpretation (`some laundry`). Their use with `no` and their combination with Saxon genitives and possessive pronouns can introduce a lexical ambiguity between the countable and the mass interpretation. This ambiguity is resolved in ACE by preferring the countable interpretation. The mass interpretation can be enforced by using the `of`-prepositional phrase.

* `John's laundry` (countable interpretation) 
* `his laundry` (countable interpretation) 
* `no laundry` (countable interpretation) 
* `some laundry of John/him` (mass interpretation)
* `a laundry of John/him` (countable interpretation) 
* `the laundry of John/him` (depends on the resolution of anaphor `the laundry`) 
* `it is false that some laundry ...` (mass interpretation) 
* `some laundry does not ...` (mass interpretation)

## Hyphenation of Phrasal and Prepositional Verbs

The same verb can appear in the categories intransitive, transitive, and ditransitive. This can lead to ambiguities. To eliminate these ambiguities, ACE expects that the phrasal particle of a phrasal verb (e.g. `look up`, `drop out`, `shut down`) and the direct preposition of a prepositional verb (e.g. `look at`, `apply for`) are hyphenated to the verb.

* `A steward waits-on the table.` (compare with: `Some hot food waits {on the table}.`) 
* `John looks-up an entry.` (compare with: `John looks {up the hill}.`) 
* `What does John apply-for?` (compare with: `John applies {for the second time}.`)

Hyphenation does not apply to ditransitive verbs since the prepositional complement is not adjacent to the verb.

* `John gives a card to a clerk. `
* `Who does John give a card to?`

## Overlap of Transitive and Ditransitive Verbs

If a verb is defined as a transitive verb and as a ditransitive verb (i.e. `regard something` / `regard something as something`) then for sentences like 

* `John regards a woman as a friend. `

the ditransitive reading has precedence. Thus, `a friend` is interpreted as the indirect object of the ditransitive verb `regards`.
