Passive sentence have the same meaning as their active counterparts.

* `A card is entered by John.` (= `John enters a card.`) 
* `A customer is given a card by John.` (= `John gives a customer a card.`)

Note that a passive sentence always needs an agent denoted by `by ...` . 

If the lexicon happens to contain the same word as participle perfect — used in a passive construct — and as intransitive adjective then users could get the mistaken impression that it is possible to build passive sentences without the `by`-construct. Assuming that `entered` occurs in the lexicon both as participle perfect and as intransitive adjective then the sentence `A card is entered.` is not a passive sentence, and `entered` is interpreted as adjective.
