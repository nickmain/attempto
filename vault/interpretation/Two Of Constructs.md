A definite noun phrase followed by an `of`-construct, as in `the father of John`, does not introduce a functional relation between John and father, but is interpreted as the relation `a father of John`.

An `of`-construct followed by a noun phrase conjunction pertains to the complete noun phrase conjunction. Thus the following sentence

* `A man sees a dog of Mary and John.`

that is ambiguous in English gets in ACE the unique interpretation that a man sees a dog that belongs to both Mary and John, i.e. as `A man sees a dog of {Mary and John}`. To express that the man sees John and a dog of Mary, one can write

* `A man sees John and a dog of Mary.`
