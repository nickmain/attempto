## Relative Clauses

Relative clauses modify the immediately preceding noun. In order to express coordination within the relative clause, the relative pronoun `who`/`that`/`which` must be repeated.

* `A customer enters {a card that carries a code} and opens an account. `
* `A customer inserts {a card that is valid and that has a code}.
`
## Binding Order

Binding order of coordinators is the following: `and` > `or` > `,and` > ,`or`  - i.e. `and` binds stronger than `or`, but this can be reversed by prefixing `and` with a comma.

* `A client {enters a red card or enters a blue card}, and enters a code.`
