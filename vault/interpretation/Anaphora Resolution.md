Resolution of anaphoric references is governed by the accessibility, recency, specificity, and reflexivity of an antecedent.

## Numbers, Expressions, Lists, Sets, Strings

Numbers, expressions, lists, sets and strings cannot be anaphorically referred to.

## Accessibility of Antecedents

Proper names are always accessible for anaphoric reference.

* `John does not see Mary. Mary waits for him.`

A noun phrase antecedent other than a proper name is not accessible if it occurs in a negated sentence, in a sentence with a modal auxiliary, in a subordinated sentence, in an interrogative sentence, or in a command.

* `John does not enter a card.` ðŸš«` It is correct.` 
	* (use instead: `John does not enter a card that is correct.`)

* `John can enter a card.` ðŸš« `It is correct.` 
	* (use instead: `John can enter a card that is correct.`)

* `It is necessary that John enters a card.` ðŸš« `It is correct. `
	* (use instead:` It is necessary that John enters a card that is correct.`) 

* `Mary believes that John enters a card.` ðŸš« `It is correct.` 
	* (use instead: `Mary believes that John enters a card that is correct.`) 

* `Does John see a car?` ðŸš« `The car is red.` 
	* (use instead: `Does John see a car that is red?`) 
	* (use instead: `A car is red. Does John see the car?`) 

* `John, identify a car!` ðŸš« `The car is red. `
	* (use instead: `John, identify the car that is red!`) 
	* (use instead: `A car is red. John, identify the car!`)


A noun phrase antecedent other than a proper name is not accessible if it occurs in a universally quantified or `if-then-` sentence.

* `Every customer has a card.` ðŸš« `It is correct. `
	* (use instead: `Every customer has a card that is correct.`) 

* `If there is a customer then he has a card.` ðŸš« `It is correct.` 
	* (use instead: `If there is a customer then he has a card that is correct.`)

However, a noun phrase antecedent in the `if`-part of a conditional sentence is accessible in the `then`-part.

* `If a customer has a card then he enters it.`

A noun phrase antecedent in a disjunction is only accessible in subsequent disjuncts.

* `A customer enters a card or drops it.` ðŸš« `It is dirty.`

## Proper Names

Each occurrence of a proper name like `John` denotes the same entity. Thus anaphoric reference to a proper name is possible using the proper name itself. 

* `John likes Mary and Mary likes John.`

## Non-Reflexive Pronouns

If the anaphor is a non-reflexive personal pronoun (`he`, `him`, ...), or a non-reflexive possessive pronoun (`his`, ...), then the anaphor is resolved with the most recent accessible noun phrase that agrees in gender and number, and that is not the subject of the verb phrase in which the anaphor occurs.

* `John has a card. Bob sees him and takes it.` 
* `John and Mary wait. They are tired.` 
* ðŸš« `John sees his wife.` 
	* (use instead: `John sees his own wife.`)

The non-reflexive personal pronoun `they` can refer to a noun phrase conjunction.

* `John and two friends walk. They are tired.`
 
Note: The pronoun `they` refers to `John and two friends`.

## Reflexive Pronouns

If the anaphor is a reflexive personal pronoun (`herself`, ...) or a reflexive possessive pronoun (`her own`, ...), then the anaphor is resolved with the subject of the sentence in which the anaphor occurs, provided that the subject agrees in gender and number with the anaphor.

* `Mary takes her own card and gets some money for herself.`
* `John and Mary admire themselves.`
* `John sees a man that sees himself.`
* `John sees a man that is seen by himself.`

## Definite Noun Phrases

if the anaphor is a definite noun phrase then it is resolved with the most recent and most specific accessible noun phrase antecedent that agrees in gender and number. 

* `There is a blue ball. There is a red ball. John sees the ball [= the red ball]. Mary sees the blue ball. `

* `There is a ball of a boy. There is a ball of a girl. John sees the ball [= the ball of a girl]. Mary sees the ball of a boy. `

* `There is a ball that is blue. There is a ball that is red. John sees the ball [= the ball that is red]. Mary sees the ball that is blue. `
 
Notice that specificity means that a definite noun phrase anaphor can also be resolved if the sentence in which the antecedent noun phrase occurs contains all the constituents of the anaphor. 

* `There is a man. His dog barks. The man whose dog barks is irritated.` (use alternatively: `There is a man whose dog barks. The man whose dog barks is irritated.`) 

* `A man owns a dog. John sees the man who owns a dog.` (use alternatively: `There is a man who owns a dog. John sees the man who owns a dog.`) 
 
If a definite noun phrase cannot be resolved then it is interpreted as an indefinite noun phrase introducing a new entity. 

* `John goes to the bank.` 
 
Note: The definite noun phrase `the bank` does not have an antecedent and introduces a new entity.

## Variables

 If the anaphor is a variable then it is resolved with an accessible noun phrase that has the variable as apposition, or with the respective "bare" variable.

* `John has a card X and a card Y. Mary takes the card. Bob takes the card X. Harry takes Y. `
* `X is heavy. John lifts X.` (= `Something X is heavy. John lifts X.`)

## Undefined Capitalized Words

An undefined word starting with a capital letter and occurring in a noun phrase position is interpreted as a singular proper name with undefined gender. Referring later to the word with a pronoun determines its gender.

*  `Leonino sleeps.`  (Note: The gender of `Leonino` is undefined.)
*  `Leonino sleeps. Her fur is wet.`

Note: The pronoun her assigns to `Leonino` the female gender. Later references must respect this.
